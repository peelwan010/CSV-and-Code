# Independent Scientific Programming & Data Analysis Experiments

This repository contains independent programming experiments focused on solving logic-heavy, mathematical, and data-driven problems using Python. The work emphasizes translating abstract requirements into executable code, handling structured data, and validating results through computation.

## Context

The experiments in this repository began as coding-focused problem solving for well-defined computational tasks. As the problems evolved, the work expanded into data exploration, matrix-based calculations, and analytical validation, where understanding the underlying logic was necessary to implement correct solutions.

The focus here is on programming and problem-solving approaches rather than domain-specific research outcomes.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`  
  CSV files used for numerical analysis and matrix-based computations.

- `scripts/`  
  Python scripts implementing mathematical operations and logic validation.

- `images/`  
  Supporting visual or relational references used during analysis.

## Focus Areas

- Python programming  
- Matrix and numerical computations  
- Data handling and transformation  
- Logical validation of computational results  

## Notes

This repository reflects exploratory and iterative work. The emphasis is on clarity of logic and correctness of implementation rather than production-level optimization.
