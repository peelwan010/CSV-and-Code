# Independent Scientific Programming & Data Analysis Experiments

This repository contains independent scientific programming work focused on implementing and validating logic-heavy, matrix-based, and data-driven computations using Python. The emphasis is on translating derived mathematical relationships into correct, reproducible code and using computation to validate analytical results.

## Context

The work in this repository began as coding-focused problem solving for well-defined computational requirements. As the problems evolved, it became necessary to derive and implement matrix-based relationships to correctly calculate an output variable (X3) from structured input parameters and data.

The primary focus here is on the computational method and its implementation rather than on domain-specific research or publication context.

## Methodology Overview

The computations in this repository implement and validate a derived matrix-based method used to calculate an output variable (X3) from structured input parameters and datasets.

This computational method was central to obtaining analytical results and was developed to ensure correctness, consistency, and reproducibility of the calculation. The code is written such that placeholder inputs can be easily replaced with real experimental or observational data without modifying the core logic.

The emphasis of this repository is on the implementation of the method itself rather than on publication-specific outcomes.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`  
  CSV files used as structured inputs for numerical and matrix-based computations.

- `scripts/`  
  Python scripts implementing derived mathematical relationships, matrix operations, and analytical validation logic.

- `images/`  
  Supporting visual or relational references used during analysis.

## Focus Areas

- Python programming
- Matrix and numerical computations
- Data handling and transformation
- Translating derived mathematical relationships into code
- Analytical validation through computation

## Notes

This repository reflects exploratory and method-focused scientific programming. The emphasis is on clarity of logic and correctness of implementation rather than production-level optimization or performance tuning.
