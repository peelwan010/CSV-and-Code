# Independent Scientific Programming & Data Analysis Experiments

This repository contains independent programming experiments focused on solving logic-heavy, mathematical, and data-driven problems using Python. The work emphasizes translating abstract requirements into executable code, handling structured data, and validating results through computation.

## Context

The experiments in this repository began as coding-focused problem solving for well-defined computational tasks. As the problems evolved, the work expanded into data exploration, matrix-based calculations, and analytical validation, where understanding the underlying logic was necessary to implement correct solutions.

The focus here is on programming and problem-solving approaches rather than domain-specific research outcomes.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`  
  CSV files used for numerical analysis and matrix-based computations.

- `scripts/`  
  Python scripts implementing mathematical operations and logic validation.

- `images/`  
  Supporting visual or relational references used during analysis.

## Focus Areas

- Python programming  
- Matrix and numerical computations  
- Data handling and transformation  
- Logical validation of computational results  

## Notes

This repository reflects exploratory and iterative work. The emphasis is on clarity of logic and correctness of implementation rather than production-level optimization.

## Methodology Overview

The computations in this repository are centered around deriving and implementing matrix-based relationships to calculate an output variable (X3) from a combination of input parameters and structured data.

The mathematical relationships were derived independently and then implemented in Python to allow:
- validation of derived formulas through computation
- regression-style analysis and numerical exploration
- easy replacement of placeholder data with real experimental or observational datasets

Randomized inputs and CSV-based data are used as stand-ins to demonstrate how the same logic can be applied directly to real scientific data without changing the core computation.
